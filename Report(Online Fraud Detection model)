Fraud Detection Model Report

1) Best Data Cleaning Techniques:
-Handled missing values through imputation or removal.
-Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding.
-Removed duplicate records to avoid redundancy.
-Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.

2) Best Model and Why
Gradient Boosting was the best model due to its ability to handle imbalanced data, capture complex patterns, and provide high accuracy with minimal overfitting.

3) Final Model and Prediction
The final model, Gradient Boosting Classifier, was trained and tested on cleaned data. It provided accurate fraud detection predictions, achieving high accuracy and minimal mean squared error (MSE).
