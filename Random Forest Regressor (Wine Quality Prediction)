Wine Quality Prediction using Random Forest Regressor

 1) Data Preprocessing Techniques

 Dataset: The dataset contains chemical properties of wine and their corresponding quality ratings.

 Handling Missing Values: Checked for missing values, but none were reported.

 Feature Engineering:

Removed irrelevant columns, if any, to enhance model performance.
Standardized numerical features for consistency.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized feature distributions using histograms and boxplots.
Generated a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between features.

2) Model Selection and Optimization

 Chosen Model: Random Forest Regressor.

 Reason: Random Forest is robust to overfitting, handles nonlinear relationships well, and provides feature importance insights.

 Initial Model Training:

Default Random Forest Regressor was trained on the dataset.
Baseline performance was measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.

 Hyperparameter Tuning:

 Used RandomizedSearchCV for tuning:

n_estimators (Number of trees)
max_depth (Tree depth)
min_samples_split (Minimum samples required to split)
min_samples_leaf (Minimum samples per leaf)
Cross-validation (CV=3) was applied to enhance model generalization.

3) Model Performance

 Initial Model Performance:

 Default Random Forest Results:

 MSE: Reported before tuning.

 R² Score: Evaluated on the test set.

 Optimized Model Performance:

The best hyperparameters from RandomizedSearchCV were used to retrain Random Forest.
Improved MSE and R² Score were achieved with the optimized model.
Feature importance analysis was conducted to determine the most significant predictors.

4) Conclusion and Findings

The optimized Random Forest model outperformed the default model, reducing prediction error.

 Future Improvements:

Experiment with boosting techniques such as XGBoost for better accuracy.
Consider additional feature engineering to enhance interpretability.
