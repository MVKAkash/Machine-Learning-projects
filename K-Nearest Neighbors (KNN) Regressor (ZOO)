Animal Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor

1) Data Preprocessing Techniques

 Dataset: The dataset contains various animal characteristics (e.g., number of legs, feathers, eggs, aquatic, airborne) with the target variable representing different animal classes.

 Handling Missing Values:

Checked for missing values; none were found.

 Feature Engineering:

 Ordinal Encoding: Applied to categorical features using OrdinalEncoder.

 Feature Scaling: Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Used Seaborn pair plots to analyze feature relationships.
Generated a correlation heatmap to observe dependencies.

2) Model Selection and Optimization

 Chosen Model: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor.

Reason: KNN is effective for classification and regression, particularly when feature relationships are non-linear.

 Data Splitting:

The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing.

 Model Training:

A KNN Regressor was trained with different values of K (neighbors).
Cross-validation was performed to optimize hyperparameters.

3) Model Performance

 Evaluation Metrics Used:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-Squared Score (RÂ²)
Confusion Matrix (for classification tasks)
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

 Results:

The optimal K-value was selected based on accuracy and error metrics.
The KNN model achieved high accuracy in classifying animals.
The confusion matrix indicated that most misclassifications occurred between similar animal types.

4) Conclusion and Findings

KNN Regressor performed well in predicting animal classification.

 Future Improvements:

Try KNN Classifier instead of regression for better categorical predictions.
Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality.
Experiment with ensemble methods like Random Forest for comparison.
