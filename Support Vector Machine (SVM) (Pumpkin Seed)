Pumpkin Seed Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

1) Data Preprocessing Techniques

 Dataset: The dataset consists of various physical and chemical properties of pumpkin seeds.

 Handling Missing Values: Checked for missing values, but none were reported.

 Feature Engineering:

Categorical columns were encoded using Label Encoding to convert them into numerical format.
Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler to improve SVM performance.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generated a correlation heatmap to analyze relationships between numerical features.
Identified key features that impact classification.

2) Model Selection and Optimization

 Chosen Model: Support Vector Regressor (SVR).

 Reason: SVM is well-suited for small to medium-sized datasets and efficiently captures nonlinear relationships.


 Initial Model Training:

Default SVR with RBF kernel was trained on standardized data.
Baseline performance was measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.

 Hyperparameter Tuning:

 Used RandomizedSearchCV for tuning:

C (Regularization parameter)
Kernel type (linear, rbf)
Gamma (Kernel coefficient)
Cross-validation (CV=3) was applied to select the best model.

3) Model Performance

 Initial Model Performance:

 Default SVR Results:

 MSE: Reported before tuning.

 R² Score: Evaluated on the test set.

 Optimized Model Performance:

The best hyperparameters from RandomizedSearchCV were used to retrain SVR.
Improved MSE and R² Score were achieved with the optimized model.
A comparison between default and tuned SVR was performed.

4) Conclusion and Findings

The optimized SVR model outperformed the default SVR, reducing prediction error.

 Future Improvements:

Experiment with polynomial kernels for potential performance gains.
Consider additional feature engineering to enhance model interpretability.
