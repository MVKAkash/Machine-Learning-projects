UK Renewable Energy Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

1) Data Preprocessing Techniques

 Dataset: The dataset contains renewable energy production data from the UK.

 Handling Missing Values: Checked for missing values and provided summary statistics.

 Feature Engineering:

Removed the "Year" column to prevent data leakage.
Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler for optimal SVM performance.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted correlation analysis using a heatmap.
Performed univariate analysis with histograms and boxplots.
Examined scatter plots to understand feature relationships.

2) Model Selection and Optimization

 Chosen Model: Support Vector Regressor (SVR).

 Reason: SVM regression is effective for capturing nonlinear relationships in energy data.

 Hyperparameter Tuning:

 Used GridSearchCV to optimize parameters such as:

C (Regularization parameter)
Kernel type (linear, rbf, poly)
Gamma (Kernel coefficient)
Epsilon (Tolerance for errors)
Applied cross-validation (CV=3) to enhance model generalization.

3) Model Performance

 Initial Model Performance:

Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) values were calculated.
Scatter plots of actual vs. predicted values were generated for visual evaluation.

 Optimized Model Performance:

The best model from GridSearchCV was retrained on the data.
Improved MSE and R² scores were reported.

4) Conclusion and Findings

The optimized SVR model achieved better predictive accuracy.
The feature importance analysis provided insights into key energy predictors.

 Future Improvements:

Experiment with different kernels and ensemble learning.
Integrate additional external factors (e.g., weather data) for better accuracy.
