Titanic Survival Prediction using Random Forest Classifier

1) Data Preprocessing Techniques

 Dataset: The dataset contains passenger details such as age, class, gender, and survival status.

 Handling Missing Values:

Numerical features were imputed with the median value.
Categorical features were imputed with the most frequent value.

 Feature Engineering:

 Removed irrelevant columns: PassengerId, Name, Ticket, and Cabin.
Converted categorical features (Sex, Embarked) into numerical values using Ordinal Encoding.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Checked frequency distributions for numerical variables.
Examined class distributions in categorical variables.

2) Model Selection and Optimization
 
 Chosen Model: Random Forest Classifier.

 Reason: Random Forest is robust against overfitting, can handle missing values, and provides feature importance insights.

 Initial Model Training:

Default Random Forest Classifier was trained on the dataset.
Performance was evaluated using Accuracy Score and Classification Report.

 Hyperparameter Tuning:

 Used RandomizedSearchCV for tuning:

n_estimators (Number of trees)
max_depth (Tree depth)
min_samples_split (Minimum samples required to split)
min_samples_leaf (Minimum samples per leaf)
Cross-validation (CV=3) was applied for better model selection.

3) Model Performance

 Initial Model Performance:

 Default Random Forest Results:

 Accuracy Score: Reported before tuning.

 Classification Report: Provided precision, recall, and F1-score.

 Optimized Model Performance:

The best hyperparameters from RandomizedSearchCV were used to retrain Random Forest.
Improved accuracy and classification metrics were observed.
Feature importance analysis was conducted to determine which features had the highest impact on survival predictions.

4) Conclusion and Findings

The optimized Random Forest model provided improved classification accuracy.

 Future Improvements:
Experiment with ensemble techniques like XGBoost for further accuracy gains.
Perform deeper feature engineering, such as creating interaction terms or deriving new insights from ticket numbers.
