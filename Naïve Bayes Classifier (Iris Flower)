Iris Flower Classification using Naïve Bayes Classifier

1) Data Preprocessing Techniques

 Dataset: The dataset consists of measurements of iris flowers (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width) with the target variable being the species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).

 Handling Missing Values: No missing values were found in the dataset.

 Feature Engineering:

Removed the Id column as it was irrelevant.
Ordinal Encoding was applied to the target variable (Species) to convert categorical labels into numerical form.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Used Seaborn pair plots to visualize the distribution of different iris species based on feature measurements.
Generated a correlation heatmap to analyze relationships between numerical features.

2) Model Selection and Optimization

 Chosen Model: Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GaussianNB).

 Reason: GaussianNB assumes a normal distribution of feature values, which aligns well with the continuous nature of the iris dataset.

 Data Splitting:

The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing.

 Model Training:

A Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier was trained on the dataset.
The model made probabilistic predictions based on feature distributions.

3) Model Performance

 Evaluation Metrics Used:

Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

 Results:

The Naïve Bayes classifier achieved high accuracy, correctly classifying most of the iris species.
Confusion matrix analysis showed that most misclassifications occurred between Versicolor and Virginica, which have overlapping feature distributions.

4) Conclusion and Findings

The Gaussian Naïve Bayes model performed well due to the normal distribution of feature values.

 Future Improvements:

Experiment with other Naïve Bayes variants like MultinomialNB or ComplementNB to analyze their impact.
Introduce Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and visualize classification boundaries.
Test with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) or Support Vector Machines (SVM) for a comparative analysis.
