K-Means Clustering Model Report (Accidents Dataset)

1) Best Data Cleaning Techniques:

 Handled missing values by:

Dropping rows where latitude/longitude was missing.
Filling other missing numerical values with 0.
Converted the 'Incident Date' column to datetime format and extracted:
Year, Month, Day, and Day of the week.
Removed outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
Standardized numerical features using MinMaxScaler.
Encoded categorical variables (State, City, and Address) using Label Encoding.

2) Best Model and Why

K-Means Clustering was used to group accident cases based on features like victims, suspects, location, and time.
The Elbow Method was applied to determine the optimal number of clusters.
The model effectively segmented accident cases into meaningful groups, helping to identify patterns in accident severity and location trends.

3) Final Model and Clustering Results

The final K-Means model was selected based on the optimal number of clusters derived from the Elbow Method.

 Key findings:

Cluster analysis showed distinct groupings based on accident severity and location.
Visualization of clusters using a scatter plot helped understand geographical accident hotspots.
The model provides insights into accident trends, which can help policymakers and safety authorities take preventive measures.
