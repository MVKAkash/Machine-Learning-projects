Weather Classification using Naïve Bayes Classifier

1) Data Preprocessing Techniques

 Dataset: The dataset contains weather attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, with the target variable being "Weather Type."

 Handling Missing Values: No explicit missing value handling was mentioned, indicating no missing data.

 Feature Engineering:

 Binning: Numerical features (e.g., Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed) were discretized into 5 bins using KBinsDiscretizer.

 Encoding:

One-Hot Encoding was applied to categorical features such as Cloud Cover, Season, and Location.
The target variable was treated as categorical.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Count plots were used to analyze the distribution of different weather types.

2) Model Selection and Optimization

 Chosen Model: Naïve Bayes Classifier (Multiple Variants).

 Reason: Naïve Bayes is efficient for categorical and discrete data and performs well in classification tasks with probabilistic assumptions.

 Different Naïve Bayes Variants Tested:

 Categorical Naïve Bayes (CategoricalNB): Used for categorical features.

 Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MultinomialNB): Applied to frequency-based features.

 Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GaussianNB): Used for continuous features after Power Transformation and Standard Scaling.

 Data Splitting: The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing.

3) Model Performance

 Evaluation Metrics Used:

Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

 Comparison of Models:

The Categorical Naïve Bayes model performed best for weather classification.
GaussianNB struggled with performance since it assumes normal distribution, whereas weather data may not follow a Gaussian pattern.
MultinomialNB performed moderately well but was not as effective as CategoricalNB.

4) Conclusion and Findings

The Categorical Naïve Bayes model was the most effective for weather classification.

 Future Improvements:

Experiment with other probabilistic classifiers, such as Bayesian Networks, for better accuracy.
Perform deeper feature engineering by extracting more meaningful weather patterns.
Consider adding more meteorological features to enhance classification performance.
