Ecommerce Customer Spending Prediction using Linear Regression


1) Data Preprocessing Techniques

Dataset: The dataset contains customer information such as session time, purchase history, and website interactions, with the target variable being the total amount spent.

 Handling Missing Values:

Checked for missing values, and none were found.

 Feature Engineering:

Removed unnecessary columns like Email to avoid irrelevant features.
Renamed columns for consistency.
Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Used Seaborn pair plots to examine relationships between numerical features.
Created a correlation heatmap to identify highly correlated features.


2) Model Selection and Optimization

 Chosen Model: 

Linear Regression.

 Reason: 

Linear Regression is suitable for continuous target prediction and helps in understanding feature impact.

 Data Splitting:

The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing.

 Model Training:

A Linear Regression model was trained on the dataset.

Predictions were made on the test set.

3) Model Performance

 Evaluation Metrics Used:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-Squared Score (R²)
Residual Plots to check for homoscedasticity.

 Results:

The model achieved a high R² score, indicating good predictive power.
MSE was relatively low, suggesting minimal error in predictions.
Feature importance analysis revealed the most influential customer attributes.

4) Conclusion and Findings

Linear Regression effectively predicted customer spending.

 Future Improvements:

Try Polynomial Regression for capturing non-linear relationships.
Use Lasso Regression to eliminate insignificant features.
Implement Random Forest Regressor for better performance with complex interactions.
