Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

1) Data Preprocessing Techniques

 Dataset: The dataset contains medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and other health indicators to predict heart disease presence.

 Handling Missing Values:

 Categorical Features: Imputed using mode.
 
 Numerical Features: Imputed using median.

 Feature Engineering:

 Encoding Categorical Variables:

 Sex: Mapped ‘Male’ to 0 and ‘Female’ to 1.

 Slope Feature: Ordinal encoding (upsloping, flat, downsloping).

One-Hot Encoding applied to categorical features (cp, fbs, restecg, exang, thal).

 Feature Scaling:

Used StandardScaler to normalize numerical features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Checked distributions of numerical features.
Analyzed class imbalance in the target variable.

2) Model Selection and Optimization

 Chosen Model: Logistic Regression.

 Reason: Logistic Regression is effective for binary classification, interpretable, and computationally efficient.

 Data Splitting:

The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing.

 Model Training:

A Logistic Regression model was trained on the dataset with max_iter = 1000 to ensure convergence.

 Performance Evaluation:

Accuracy and error metrics were calculated on the test set.

3) Model Performance

 Evaluation Metrics Used:
Accuracy Score
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

 Results:

The Logistic Regression model achieved good accuracy in predicting heart disease.
Confusion matrix analysis indicated some misclassification between heart disease presence and absence.

4) Conclusion and Findings

Logistic Regression performed well, making it a suitable model for medical diagnosis.

 Future Improvements:

Experiment with ensemble models like Random Forest or XGBoost for better predictive power.
Address class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
Consider adding more medical history features to improve accuracy.
