Hierarchical Clustering Model Report (Online Retail Dataset)

1) Best Data Cleaning Techniques:

Handled missing values by removing rows with missing 'CustomerID'.
Filtered out transactions with negative or zero values in 'Quantity' and 'UnitPrice'.

 Created a Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model:

 Recency: Days since last purchase.

 Frequency: Number of unique transactions.

 Monetary: Total amount spent.
Standardized features using StandardScaler.

2) Best Model and Why

Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative Clustering) was used to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.
Dendrograms were utilized to determine the optimal number of clusters.
The Ward linkage method was chosen as it minimizes variance within clusters, ensuring high-quality segmentation.

3) Final Model and Clustering Results

The final model grouped customers into segments based on purchasing patterns.

 Key findings:

Different customer clusters showed variations in recency, frequency, and spending behavior.
Visualization using scatter plots helped interpret customer segments.
The model can help businesses tailor marketing strategies based on customer segmentation.
