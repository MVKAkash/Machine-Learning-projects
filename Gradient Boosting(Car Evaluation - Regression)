Gradient Boosting Model Report (Car Evaluation - Regression)

1) Best Data Cleaning Techniques:

Checked for missing values and confirmed that the dataset was complete.

 Mapped categorical target variable to numerical values:

'unacc' → 0
'acc' → 1
'good' → 2
'vgood' → 3

 Encoded categorical features using Ordinal Encoding with predefined rankings:

Buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, seating capacity, luggage boot size, and safety were mapped in order of priority.

2) Best Model and Why

XGBoost Regressor was used to predict car evaluation scores.

 Why XGBoost?

Handles both categorical and numerical data efficiently.
Captures complex relationships in ordinal data.
Provides high accuracy with minimal overfitting.

3) Final Model and Prediction

 Final Model: XGBoost Regressor trained on encoded dataset.

 Performance Metrics:

 Mean Squared Error (MSE): Used to evaluate prediction error.

 R² Score: Measured how well the model explains the variance in car evaluations.

 Findings:

The model successfully predicts car evaluation ratings based on input features.
Feature importance analysis shows that safety and buying price are the most influential factors.
